- 👋 Hi, I’m @joe-woodhouse
- 👀 I’m interested in database engineering, DevOps, DataOps, data engineering, data science
- 🧙 My background is database engineering, earlier database administration, more recently DevOps.
- 🌱 I’m currently adding data engineering and DataOps to my repertoire; I have some gaps to fill as database engineering and data engineering overlap about 85%.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything worked remotely, preferably in a B2B consultant/contract basis but salary is an option if not exclusive
- 📫 How to reach me: email at joe.woodhouse@primadonnaconsulting.com
